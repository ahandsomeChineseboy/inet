Priority Buffer
===============

This step demonstrates the :ned:`PriorityBuffer` module. The module has a configurable
packet dropping stragegy; by default, the module drops packets belonging to the last
connected queue.

In this step, packets are produced periodically (randomly) by two active packet
sources (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are collected periodically (randomly)
by two active packet sinks (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`). The sources and the sinkes are
connected by packet queues (:ned:`PacketQueue`) and packets are stored in shared packet
buffer (:ned:`PacketBuffer`). The packet buffer drops packets when it gets overloaded
prioritizing over the packet queues.
