Storing Packets on Behalf of Multiple Queues
============================================

.. Buffer
   Storing packets in a buffer shared among multiple queues

This step demonstrates the :ned:`PacketBuffer` module. The module stores packets on
behalf of multiple queues, acting as a shared packet buffer for them.

In this step, packets are produced periodically (randomly) by two active packet
sources (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are collected periodically (randomly)
by two active packet sinks (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`). The sources and the sinks are
connected by packet queues (:ned:`PacketQueue`) and packets are stored in a shared packet
buffer (:ned:`PacketBuffer`). The packet buffer drops packets from the beginning of
the buffer when it gets overloaded.
